# Sudoku-Solver
A blank sudoku grid will be presented to the user with each square only accepting a number from 0 to 9. Once the user has filled in desired squares, the program will test if the inputs are permitted or forbidden. If permitted, it will test if there is one solution and then show what that solution is if desired.
